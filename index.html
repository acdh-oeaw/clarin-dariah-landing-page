<div id="introduction">
    <p>
        CLARIN and DARIAH are two European Research Infrastructure Consortia for data-driven research
        in the Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences.
        They offer technical and social infrastructures in a sustainable way
        and also play important roles in educating new generations
        of researchers and shaping national and European research policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        CLARIN’s and DARIAH’s members are countries. Member countries implement and
        run national infrastructures that conform to either one of the two initiatives' requirements.
        In some countries, national infrastructures conform to both CLARIN’s
        and DARIAH’s requirements. Consequently CLARIN and DARIAH will check continuously that these
        requirements are compatible.
    </p>
